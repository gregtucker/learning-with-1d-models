    "## How do I run the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, run the complete notebook (Cell => Run All).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, page down to the section \"Example model run\" to see an example of how to run the model and plot its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, continue on to the section \"Your turn\" to read about how to change parameters and re-run the model. Use the cells below that section to type your commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to see and do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Watch the movie in the example run. The dashed line shows the expected steady state water table: the water table position that occurs when the recharge entering the aquifer from above is exactly balanced by the outflow along the right-side boundary. Approximately how long does this run take to reach that steady state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with changing the value of hydraulic conductivity ($K$). How does conductivity influence the height of the water table when the system is in steady state? How does it influence the time needed to reach steady state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with changing the value of recharge ($R$). How does recharge influence the height of the water table when the system is in steady state? How does it influence the time needed to reach steady state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you simultaneously double both the recharge and conductivity, does the steady state water table height change? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given what you have observed, would you expect the water table in a dry climate (low $R$) to be higher or lower than in a wet climate (high $R$), all else equal?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If recharge were to suddenly change, which aquifer would respond faster: one with a high conductivity, or one with a low conductivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's under the hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model using the Dupuit approximation for a \"shallow\" unconfined aquifer, with the hydraulic gradient equal to the water table gradient. The aquifer sits on top of a horizontal impermeable layer. Darcy's law for this situation can be written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q = -K H \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $q$ is the water discharge per unit aquifer width, $H$ is the aquifer thickness (and also the height of the water table above the horizontal impermeable layer), and $x$ is distance from the left edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass balance says that the rate of rise or fall of the water table at a particular position depends on the incoming recharge rate, $R$, minus the derivative of discharge:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1-\\phi ) \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = R - \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is time and $\\phi$ is porosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is solved (approximated) numerically using a finite-difference scheme. The left boundary is an impermeable \"wall\"; the right boundary is a seepage face, meaning that the water table thickness is zero at this edge, and the water percolates out to the right at a rate that depends on the water table slope (hydraulic gradient) and aquifer thickness."
